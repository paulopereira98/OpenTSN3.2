Because there are differences in the generation of IP cores used for different platforms or different FPGA devices, the IP core file needs to be generated by the user according to the provided IP core configuration parameters.
A total of 14 IP core files are used in the TSN network card hardware core code. The detailed configuration parameters of the IP core are as follows:
(1) IP core: 2-port RAM
    ipcore_name:asdprf16x8_rq
    Operation Mode:With one read port and one write port
    Ram_width:8
    Ram_depth: 16
    Clocking method:dual clock:use separate 'read' and 'write' clocks
    Create a 'rden' read enable signal:selected
    Read input aclrs:selected
    Others:default

(2) IP core: 2-port RAM
    ipcore_name:asdprf16x9_rq
    Operation Mode:With one read port and one write port

    Read input aclrs:selected
    Others: default

(3) IP core: FIFO
    ipcore_name: DCFIFO_10bit_64
