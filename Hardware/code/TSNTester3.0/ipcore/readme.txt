Because there are differences in the generation of IP cores used for different platforms or different FPGA devices, the IP core file needs to be generated by the user according to the provided IP core configuration parameters.
A total of 8 IP core files are used in the hardware core code of the TSN tester. The detailed configuration parameters of the IP core are as follows:
(1) IP core: 2-port RAM
    ipcore_name: ram_sdport_w128d32
    Operation Mode:With one read port and one write port
    Ram_width: 128
    Ram_depth: 32
    Clocking method : Single
    Create a 'rden' read enable signal:selected
    Others:default

(2) IP core: 2-port RAM
    ipcore_name: ram_sdport_w128d64
    Operation Mode:With one read port and one write port
    Ram_width: 128
    Ram_depth: 64
    Clocking method : Single
    Create a 'rden' read enable signal:selected
    Others:default

(3) IP core: 2-port RAM
    ipcore_name: ram_sdport_separaterwclock_rdaclr_w8d16
    Operation Mode:With one read port and one write port
    Ram_width:8
    Ram_depth: 16
    Clocking method : Single
    Clocking method:dual clock:use separate 'read' and 'write' clocks
    Create a 'rden' read enable signal:selected
    Read input aclrs:selected
    Others:default

(4) IP core: FIFO
    ipcore_name: fifo_w134d128_commonclock_sclr_showahead
    Operation Mode:With two read/write ports
    Ram_width: 134
    Ram_depth: 128
    Clock for reading and writing the FIFO : synchronize both reading and writing to 'clock'.
     Read access:show_ahead synchronous FIFO mode
    Reset: Synchronous clear
    Others:default


(5) IP core: FIFO
    ipcore_name: fifo_w31d4_commonclock_sclr_showahead
    Operation Mode:With two read/write ports
    Ram_width: 31
    Ram_depth: 4
    Clock for reading and writing the FIFO : synchronize both reading and writing to 'clock'.
     Read access:show_ahead synchronous FIFO mode
    Reset: Synchronous clear
    Others:default

(6) IP core: FIFO
    ipcore_name: fifo_w12d4_commonclock_sclr_showahead
    Operation Mode:With two read/write ports
    Ram_width: 12
    Ram_depth: 4
    Clock for reading and writing the FIFO : synchronize both reading and writing to 'clock'.
     Read access:show_ahead synchronous FIFO mode
    Reset: Synchronous clear
    Others:default

(7) IP core: FIFO
    ipcore_name: fifo_w9d16_respectclock_aclr_showahead
    Operation Mode:With two read/write ports
    Ram_width:9
    Ram_depth: 16
    Clock for reading and writing the FIFO : synchronize reading and writing to 'rdclk' and 'wrclk', respectively.
    Asynchronous clear: selected
    Read access:Normal synchronous FIFO mode
    Others:default

(8) IP core: FIFO
    ipcore_name: DCFIFO_10bit_64
    Fifo_width: 10
    Fifo_depth: 64
    Clock for reading and writing the FIFO : synchronize reading and writing to 'rdclk' and 'wrclk', respectively.
    Asynchronous clear: selected
    Read access:Normal synchronous FIFO mode
    Others:default
