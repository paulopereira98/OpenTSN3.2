Because there are differences in the generation of IP cores used for different platforms or different FPGA devices, the IP core file needs to be generated by the user according to the provided IP core configuration parameters.
A total of 13 IP core files are used in the TSN switch hardware core code. The detailed configuration parameters of the IP core are as follows:
(1) IP core: 2-port RAM
    Ip_core_name: asdprf16x8_rq
    Operation Mode:With one read port and one write port
    Ram_width:8
    Ram_depth: 16
