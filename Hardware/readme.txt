In order to facilitate users to port OpenTSN hardware (including TSN switches, TSN network cards and TSN testers) to other devices and increase or decrease the number of interfaces of OpenTSN hardware, the OpenTSN hardware code is divided into two parts, namely core code and device Code related to the interface.
Each folder in this directory is described as follows:
code: This folder is used to store the core code of OpenTSN hardware. The code in this folder has nothing to do with the number of devices and interfaces; if users need to transplant OpenTSN hardware to other FPGA devices or change the number of interfaces, they can refer to the project_demo folder for storage (device and interface related) code to write the corresponding device code and the corresponding interface quantity code
project_demo: This folder is used to store OpenTSN hardware example project scripts to automatically compile related files; the code stored in this folder is the code related to the device (Intel Arria10:10AX048H2F34E2SG) and the number of interfaces (4 gigabit interfaces), but does not store OpenTSN The core code of the hardware; the code in this folder and the code in the code folder are the code of the complete example project
doc: This folder is used to store OpenTSN hardware design documents and manuals
